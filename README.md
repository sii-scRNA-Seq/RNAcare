Patients RNA-seq and Clinic data Explorer
Gene expression analysis is a powerful tool to gain insight into the mechanisms and processes underlying the biological and phenotypic differences between sample groups and requires highly professional skills for scientists to access, integrate and analyse gene expression. Previously related research focus on establishing tools and platform form single cell RNA-seq analysis, which provide user-friendly graphic interfaces to perform interactive and reproducible gene expression analysis of microarray and RNA-seq datasets and generate a range of publication ready figures. However, those harmonised datasets are not bulked RNA datasets and not patient specific. For some experiments, patient specific samples are collected and cannot be directly applied by this platform. Our platform, provides a solution for performing interactive and reproducible analysis of microarray and RNA-seq bulked gene expression data, enable medical researchers to perform exploratory data analysis and find different/common pattern among patients with similar diseases without informatics proficiency.
